####Application Details:

This web page is designed to allow users to purchase home made jewelry. Utilizing all facets of stack-engineering, this application includes both a polished front-end UI to deliver an optimal user experience, as well as a command line application for the owner of the store to update the current stock and view any orders that still need to be filled. Users may create an account to save their carts if they would like to return at a later point.
